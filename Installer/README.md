### TF-BAMF Installer

This installer is based on NSIS 3.09

The scripts in this directory will build to an executable installer/uninstaller for the entire project.  
The initial script was created using NSIS Quick Setup Script Generator 1.09.18


TODOs:
* Insert more placeholder variables into script
* Figure out usage of wildcards
* Add autogenerated folders to delete list for uninstaller
* TEST!
* add custom installation options in UI
* Investigate automatic VPK cooking from BAMF Asset Packs
* Experiment with removing metadata fields from Install script (corporation, versionnumber, etc)
* Make stuff look good
* Separate Installer version from TF BAMF version
* Verify correct TF2 installation directory by aiming at Team Fortress 2/tf/gameinfo.txt
* Check existence of Team Fortress/bin/vpk.exe prior to automatic VPK cooking
* Create readme.txt to show users after installation (.md will probably not work, since .md typically has not default application in windows)

Build-Requirements:
* NSIS 3.09
* NUI Plugin for NSIS
Future plugin requirements:
* Banner or Splash
* nsDialogs
* vPatch
