           A TF2 MAPPING STARTER PACK OF THE MODERN ERA

This pack is intended as a basic toolset for anyone mapping for TF2 or its
many mods. It includes a large amount of resources, tools, features, and
guides that will help you on your mapping journey. All features are modular
and can be combined with other mapping packs, asset collections, sourcemods,
or whatever else you want to do to the Source Engine. All contents of BAMF,
unless explicitly noted, are released under CC-BY-SA4.0, giving you
permission to freely use, modify and rerelease them with credit.

For beginners, it contains improved entity documentation in Hammer, a hand-
made error parser (with explanations) for CompilePal, a selection of basic
logic and gamemode prefabs, and a full library of released and decompiled
Valve maps.

For experts, it contains Propper and RadShadowMan and their setups,
additional customization options in the FGD, advanced CompilePal pre-sets,
and a selection of ready-made dev textures and map elements to allow quick
iteration for testing purposes.
