Feedback and Todos:

-Uninstaller seems to delete all files as intended, but leaves empty folders behind. Not ideal for things like tf/custom/Extra Materials. @lco-sp: Could not reproduce, verfiy with tester!
-Cannot leave dir2/dir3 paths empty even if components are not intended to be installed
-Clarify that paths for unused components can be ignored/left at default as they won't be used
-improve how_to_change_fgd.txt, perhaps use hmtl or refer to bamf.tf/pack/install.html directly
-split Install section on bamf.tf into:
	-install.html (using installer)
	-install-basic.html (current install.html)
	-install-advanced.html (unchanged)
-change order of configurations so that Basic Installation is selected by default instead of Full Installation.
-add requirements to component descriptions
-rework assets/bamf-readme.txt and add links
	
Content for Installer page:
-clarify BAMF can be installed over existing installations, but uninstalling and then reinstalling may be cleaner
-clarify how to uninstall via Apps & Features, and where the uninstaller lives
