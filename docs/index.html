					This pack is intended as a basic toolset for anyone mapping for TF2 or its many mods. It includes a large amount of resources, tools, features, and guides that will help you on your mapping journey. All features are modular and can be combined with other mapping packs, asset collections, sourcemods, or whatever else you want to do to the Source Engine.

					<b>For beginners</b>, it contains improved entity documentation in Hammer, a hand-made error parser (with explanations) for CompilePal, a selection of basic logic and gamemode prefabs, and a full library of released and decompiled Valve maps. <br> <br>
					<b>For experts</b>, it contains Propper and RadShadowMan and their setups, additional customization options in the FGD, advanced CompilePal pre-sets, and a selection of ready-made dev textures and map elements to allow quick iteration for testing purposes. <br> <br>
